# **App Name**: Luminous Clicks

## Core Features:

- Custom Cursor: Replace the default mouse cursor with a custom luminous circle made of particles.
- Click Animation: Trigger a detailed particle animation at the click position.
- Shape Cycling: Cycle through different shapes (heart, star, circle, etc.) composed of pink particles on each click.
- Smooth Transitions: Implement smooth transitions (scale, opacity, rotation) for the particle animation effects.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant pink (#FF69B4) to dominate the visual elements.
- Background color: Dark black (#000000), which provides maximum contrast and makes the luminous particles stand out.
- Accent color: Light pink (#FFB6C1) to add a subtle highlight to interactive particle elements.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a techy, modern feel in headlines and short texts, ensuring readability against the dark background.
- Use simple, glowing shapes (heart, star, circle) formed by particles for the click animations, emphasizing their luminous quality.
- Use subtle scale, opacity, and rotation animations to create a fluid transition effect for clicks, focusing on particle movement and dispersion.
- Full screen layout to maximize the impact of the cursor and click animations, allowing the particle effects to be fully appreciated against the black background.
